/**
 * The AnimatedActor class serves as a superclass for other, more specific
 * Actor classes. It provides a mechanism to give actors an animated image.<p>
 * 
 * To use this class, you need a sequence of image files to be used for the
 * animation. Let's say we create four files named "cat0.png", "cat1.png",
 * "cat2.png" and "cat3.png". In this case, our base name would be "cat", the
 * suffix is ".png", and the number of images is 4.<p>
 * 
 * You can create an animated actor by subclassing this class, and calling this
 * class's constructor with the base name, suffix, and number of images as a 
 * parameter. So, to make an animated cat, I might have a subclass 'Cat' with 
 * the folling constructor"<p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 *   public Cat() {
 *       super("cat", ".png", 4);
 *   }
 * <pre>
 * 
 * The image files have to be numbered starting at 0, and they have to ve in the
 * scenario's 'image' folder.<p>
 * 
 * The image will change with every act step.
